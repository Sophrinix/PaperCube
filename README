and things will be added later. If you have specific questions, please email

===========

RUNNING PAPERCUBE
PaperCube uses SproutCore 0.9. To run in development, start sc-server in the
main directory:

% cd papercube
% sc-server

Then, point your browser to the following URL:

http://localhost:4020/papercube

===========

BUILDING PAPERCUBE
To build, in the main directory, run sc-build. Copy the resulting build to your
web server. Please note that the sc-config file at the root of the directory
can be used to customize it further.

===========

DATABASE AND SCHEMA
Currently, the API is PHP-based. In the "database_api" directory, there is a file, 
"request.php" that interfaces with the database.

Currently, the database relies on CiteSeer. The database is quite large, but an
exported version of the database is available at the following URL: 
http://www.peterbergstrom.com/citeseer_final.zip

The schema is available in the "database_api" directory in "database.txt"

Please note that in the code, there are references to "/api/request.php". If 
you change your server or install location, this will be different.
